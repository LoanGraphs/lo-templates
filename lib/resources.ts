        body: `In today's competitive housing market, a pre-approval letter is table stakes. Sellers and their agents won't take your offer seriously without one. More importantly, getting pre-approved before you shop tells you exactly how much home you can afford — so you don't fall in love with a home that's out of reach.

A pre-approval is more than a pre-qualification. Pre-qual is a quick estimate based on self-reported info. Pre-approval involves submitting actual documentation, having your credit pulled, and going through initial underwriting. A strong pre-approval letter signals to sellers that you're a serious, financeable buyer.

Most pre-approvals take 24–48 hours once you submit complete documentation. The key is having everything ready to go from the start. Missing documents are the number one cause of delays.`,

    excerpt:
      "Your Loan Estimate is the most important document in your mortgage process. Here's how to read it line by line and avoid being overcharged.",

    sections: [
      {
        heading: "What Is a Loan Estimate and Why Does It Matter?",
        body: `The Loan Estimate (LE) is a standardized 3-page document that lenders are legally required to provide within 3 business days of receiving your mortgage application. It replaced the older Good Faith Estimate (GFE) in 2015 and is your primary tool for comparing mortgage offers from different lenders.

Every lender uses the exact same format — that's the point. When you get LEs from three different lenders for the same loan, you can compare them side by side and see exactly where the differences are.

The LE is not a commitment to lend. It's an estimate. But closing costs cannot increase by more than 10% (for most fees) and the interest rate cannot change (if you've locked it) between the LE and the final Closing Disclosure. Understanding what's on the LE helps you spot overcharges, ask the right questions, and make an informed decision.`,
      },
      {
        heading: "Page 1: Loan Terms and Projected Payments",
        body: `The first page of the LE has the key loan parameters. Here's what each section tells you.

Loan Terms Box (top right): This summarizes the core loan details — loan amount, interest rate, monthly principal & interest payment, whether the rate or payment can increase (it should say "NO" for fixed-rate loans), and whether there's a prepayment penalty or balloon payment. Read this carefully. Any "YES" boxes need a full explanation.

Projected Payments: This breaks down what your total monthly payment will be, including principal & interest, mortgage insurance (PMI or MIP), and estimated escrow (taxes + insurance). The "Year 1" column shows your first year payment. For loans with MIP that falls off, it may show a different payment in later years.

Costs at Closing: A summary box showing estimated closing costs and estimated cash to close. This is the headline number most borrowers focus on — but always dig into the details on page 2 to understand what's driving it.`,
      },
      {
        heading: "Page 2: Closing Cost Details — Where to Find Overcharges",
        body: `Page 2 is where the money details live. It's divided into sections A through H.

Section A — Origination Charges: This is what the lender charges you directly. It includes origination fees, underwriting fees, discount points (if any), and processing fees. There is no standard — lenders charge what they want here. Compare Section A across lenders to see who's charging more for the loan itself.

Section B — Services You Cannot Shop For: These are third-party services the lender selects — appraisal, credit report, flood determination, tax monitoring. You can't shop these, but you can compare them across lenders' LEs to spot outliers.

Section C — Services You Can Shop For: Title insurance, settlement/closing agent, title search, survey. You CAN shop these. A good title company or closing attorney can save you $300–$800 vs the lender's default pick. Ask your real estate agent for referrals.

Section E — Taxes and Other Government Fees: Recording fees and transfer taxes. These are largely fixed by the county/state.

Section F — Prepaids: These are not fees — they're prepaid expenses you'd owe regardless of who your lender is. Includes prepaid interest (from closing date to end of month), homeowners insurance premium (first year), and mortgage insurance premium if applicable.

Section G — Initial Escrow Payment at Closing: The upfront funding of your escrow account for future tax and insurance payments. Typically 2–3 months of taxes and insurance. Again, not a lender fee.

Section H — Other: Anything else, including HOA transfer fees or home warranty. These vary by transaction.`,
      },
      {
        heading: "Comparing LEs: A Step-by-Step Process",
        body: `To compare two LEs properly, follow this process.

Step 1: Confirm the loan details match. Same loan amount, same loan type (30yr fixed, etc.), same lock period. If they're not identical, the comparison isn't apples-to-apples.

Step 2: Compare Section A (Origination Charges). This is the pure lender markup. If Lender A charges $2,500 in Section A and Lender B charges $800, Lender B is cheaper — assuming the rates are the same. If Lender A has a lower rate, check if discount points in Section A explain it (points buy the rate down).

Step 3: Compare the interest rate. Lower is better, but see Step 2 — a lower rate might come with higher points.

Step 4: Look at the APR. The Annual Percentage Rate factors in certain fees and gives a more complete cost picture. Compare APRs as a sanity check on which loan is truly cheaper.

Step 5: Total the "Origination Charges" (Section A) + the interest rate impact over your expected hold period to find the true cost difference.

Step 6: Shop Section C services. Title insurance and settlement fees can vary. You don't have to use the lender's recommended providers for these.

Pro tip: When you get a Loan Estimate from a lender, you can take it to a competing lender and say "can you beat this?" The transparency of the standardized form makes comparison shopping more effective than ever. Call your loan officer at 555-123-4567 — we'll review any LE you've received and make sure you're getting a competitive deal.`,
